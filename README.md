# Hi, I'm Angela.
This readme is a cover letter and self-introduction. Hopefully, this provides some insight to who I am and why I code.

## I learn fast, I'm driven by passion, and I'm not afraid to challenge myself.
My love for CS began late, and by a total fluke.

In January 2020, I enrolled in Dartmouth's introductory CS course with 0 coding knowledge and 0 expectation. 

With one `Hello World`, I was immediately hooked. I became so enthralled with CS that I learned the entire 10-week course curriculum on my own **in just 10 days**.

But I didn't stop just there. During the remaining 9 weeks of winter term, I created an [API project](https://github.com/azhang4216/redditapi){:target="_blank"} and a [personal website](http://angelazz.me/){:target="_blank"} through picking up what information I could from online forums and documentations. I faced a lot of setbacks and frustration with these projects, having to learn on my own with little CS knowledge and no guidance, but I pushed through and perservered.

My passion for CS and quick learning got me noticed at Dartmouth's selective tech incubator, [the DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/){:target="_blank"}. While most (if not all) admitted students had taken higher-level CS courses, I was admitted as one of the youngest developers in lab history (18), and as someone who had, at the time, only taken the introductory CS course.

Despite unfamiliar technologies and a foreign setting, I worked hard to learn many new fullstack technologies during my first term. I then applied these skills in a team setting, working with fellow DALI developers, designers, a PM, and company partners to create a [fullstack web app](https://pine-beetle-prediction-dev.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"} for the US Forest Service. Through our efforts, we were able to improve prediction generation time from several minutes to seconds, and improve user experience through interactive data visualization. The app is now deployed and up for public use.

Besides CS at Dartmouth, **I am always looking for more ways to challenge myself in CS.** I challenge myself with other opportunities such as hackathons (e.g. HackDavis, FemmeHacks), TAing & tutoring, and [personal projects](https://github.com/azhang4216){:target="_blank"}. 

Having had a taste of what working in a team to create a app is like, **one of my goals is to have internship / co-op opportunities to further develop my skills in a workplace setting.**

## I work well under pressure. I am accountable, responsible, and reliable.

During freshman year, as part of our statistics class, I had to work with other team members to conduct an independent research project. 

Two members out of 4 dropped out 2 weeks in, leaving only me and one other freshman to complete the project in 5 weeks. 

Despite the sudden change in plans, I remained calm under pressure. **I did not blame others or get frustrated at the predicament. Instead, I did the best I could to complete the project to a high standard.** I met with my partner to devise a clear-cut plan given the situation, our limitations, and the scope of the project. 

As a result of good communication and team work, we created [a great research project](https://github.com/azhang4216/divisions-of-wealth){:target="_blank"}, earning one of the highest marks in the class as a result of our quality research and data analysis despite having only 2 members instead of 4 or 5.

I believe that my level-headedness and accoutability make me an ideal candidate for an internship / co-op, where things are often unpredictable and require fast, calculated decison making.

## I am a team player and communicate effectively with others. This comes from being a student-athlete.
As a recruited Division I student-athlete, being a team-player and hard worker is a prerequisite.

When competition is stiff and other team members feel down, I cheer others up. I listen to others when they have concerns, and I bridge the gap between different team members and coaches. 

As a result of my sportsmanship, work ethic, and performances, I have earned the title of the team's **coMVP and rookie of the year**.

I apply the same level of dedication and teamwork in CS. As a software developer for my school's tech incubator DALI Lab, I work in teams of student developers, designers, PMs and with company sponsors. I succeed in effective communication, setting clear goals, and working collaboratively with other team members, resulting in quality products and good morale within the team.

**I bring my communication skills and team player mentality on every project and team I work on.**

## I have an amazing sense of humor. *(Yes, that's absolutely objective.)*

Here's my go-to CS joke: 

> Your dog ate your computer science homework?

> Yes, it took him a couple of bytes.

## I am approachable.
If you have any questions, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:angela.zhang.23@dartmouth.edu). I promise I don't *byte*!
